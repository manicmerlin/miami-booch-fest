# üöÄ GoDaddy Deployment Guide

## Method 1: Static File Upload (Easiest)

### Step 1: Build the static files
```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an `out` folder with all your static files.

### Step 2: Upload to GoDaddy
1. **Login to your GoDaddy cPanel**
   - Go to godaddy.com ‚Üí My Products ‚Üí Web Hosting ‚Üí Manage
   
2. **Access File Manager**
   - Click "File Manager" in the cPanel
   - Navigate to `public_html` folder (this is your website root)
   
3. **Upload your files**
   - Delete any existing files in `public_html` (except hidden files like .htaccess)
   - Upload ALL contents from the `out` folder to `public_html`
   - Make sure `index.html` is in the root of `public_html`

### Step 3: Configure domain
- Your website should now be live at `miamiboochfest.com`!
